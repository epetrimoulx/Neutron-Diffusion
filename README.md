# Neutron-Diffusion #

 My final project for computational physics where I simulate the neutron diffusion process within an atomic bomb.


## TO DO:
1. Modify diffusion_3d to move the timesteps outside of the function. Pass timesteps into it as a parameter.
2. Once the timesteps are outside of the diffusion function, we can change the initial conditions upon every pass of the function call at each timestep by moving the two objects closer together.
